# Protein Engineering in Python

This project contains a Python class named `KEX`, implemented in the `script.py` file. The class provides core functionality for our protein engineering workflow, including docking, molecular dynamics, and analysis tools.

Our usage of the `KEX` class can be found in the Jupyter notebooks included in the project. Output data and results are organized in the corresponding folders.

To use `smina`, make sure the `custom_scoring_function.txt` file is present in the current working directory. Also, create the required Conda environment using:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
